The entire select/enter/exit/update pattern with D3 is in direct conflict with React and its virtual DOM. If you\u2019re coming to React from D3, giving up your grip on the DOM is one of those \u201ccold, dead hands\u201d moments. The way most people use D3 with React is to use React to build the structure of the application, and to render traditional HTML elements, and then when it comes to the data visualization section, they pass a DOM container (typically an <svg>) over to D3 and use D3 to create and destroy and update elements. In a way, it\u2019s similar to the way we used to use Java applets or Flash to run a black box in your page while the rest of your page is rendered separately. The benefit of this method of integrating React and D3 is that you can use all the same kind of code you see in all the core D3 examples. The main difficulty is that you need to create functions in various React lifecycle events to make sure your viz updates.", "description": "", "created_on": "2020-04-01T08:46:17.652Z", "image": "images/worlmap.PNG", "category": 5, "language": 2, "react_tag": "WorldMap"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.author", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "Osmar", "last_name": "Alcala", "created_on": "2020-02-03T20:23:47.171Z", "image": "images/WhatsApp_Image_2020-02-03_at_11.56.37.jpeg", "email": null}}, {"model": "sampleapp.category", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "Machine Learning"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.category", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "Algorithm Design"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.category", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "Optimization Models"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.category", "pk": 4, "fields": {"name": "Predictive Modeling"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.category", "pk": 5, "fields": {"name": "Spatial"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.language", "pk": 1, "fields": {"name": "Python"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.language", "pk": 2, "fields": {"name": "JavaScript"}}, {"model": "sampleapp.language", "pk": 3, "fields": {"name": "CSS"}}]
